# NS3-Wireless-Simulation
This project demonstrates a simple wireless network simulation using the NS-3 framework. It creates two wireless nodes, sets up Wi-Fi communication, and simulates data transmission between them. The code provides insights into configuring network parameters, defining node mobility, and running simulations in NS-3.
